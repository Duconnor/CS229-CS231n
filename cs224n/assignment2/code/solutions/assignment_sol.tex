{\bf{(a)}} See file q1\_softmax.py\par
{\bf{(b)}} See file q1\_softmax.py\par
{\bf{(c)}} The purpose of placeholder is to hold our input data, and the purpose of feed dictionaries is to feed input values to placeholders. See implementation in file q1\_classifier.py\par
{\bf{(d)}} See file q1\_classifier.py\par
{\bf({e})} See file q1\_classifier.py. After the model's {\emph{train\_op}} is called, the prediction {\emph{y\_hat}} is computed in the forward propagation and the gradient of loss with respect to {\emph{W}} and {\emph{b}} is computed during the back propagation. The variable {\emph{W}} and {\emph{b}} will be changed.\par
